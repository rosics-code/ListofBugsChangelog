You get repeatedly singed out on 2.0 pages and see the Privacy Policy Banner from 2023. this may be due to some signatures using tinypic, a hosting service <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyPic#:%7E:text=The%20service%20shut%20down%20on%2C2019%20due%20to%20declining%20income.">which shut down on September 9th 2019 due to declining income.</a>

Sometimes when posting a new post to a topic (e.g. bumping) it will not go to page 1, so you would have to bump twice or add on to things.
You can go to any site in the post preview (the checkmark button), this is because it is an Iframe (embed), which should be fixed.
Last post will say the wrong last post. (take for example right now:
<br>

Firefox has worse performance when running scratch projects, however, you can always try fixing NextDNS.
<br>
<br>
