<strong>⛔ Important Bugs:</strong>
<br>
Sometimes when going to a comment from a link or messages, it takes forever to load, however you can:
<br>
1. Go to the profile and find your comment.
<br>
2. Hard reset Ctrl+F5 (Command+F5).
<br>
3. Reload page a bunch of times.
<br>
4. Delete browser history. (If you need to do this)
<br>
5. Delete cookies and reload. (You will be signed out but sign back in) (if you need to do this)
<br>
6. If it didn't work repeat the steps.
<br>
You get repeatedly singed out on 2.0 pages source and see the Privacy Policy Banner from 2023. source this may be due to some signatures using tinypic which shut down on September 9th 2019 due to declining income.
<br>

<strong>✏️ Editor Bugs:</strong>
<br>
Some reporters are aligned incorrectly. Lists are aligned to the left, and custom block boolean inputs are aligned to the right.
<br>

When switching the rays backdrop to bitmap then back to vector, it crashes. source
<br>
There's a small gap between block dropdowns. source
Sounds get quieter when visiting the sound tab. source
<br>
Sometimes when using bitmap and placing down a circle, it should go to bitmap after being vector when deselecting it, however this user reports that it doesn't go to bitmap after deselecting it. source
When putting a reporter in a color input and undoing, the color input disappears. source
<br>
Long sounds get muted after a while.
<br>
When putting nothing in the custom block, you get a half cut stack block.
<br>
Sound editor doesn't load and clicking a few sprites throws an error. source
<br>

This bug after choosing a sprite where it still shows the “choose a sprite” tooltip.
<br>
When you try to delete a sprite at the bottom, the pop-up goes off the screen.
<br>
On the top bar of the editor, the share button and the project name and see project page is condensed due to the debug button, same when you see inside a project you do not own.
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is due to the icons using bit ly, some schools block it.

Debug icon not loading on some devices.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>⚙️ Technical Bugs:</strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Scratch cloud variable monitor page is not loading, also scratches cloud variables do not work at all as well source this is due to an endpoint clouddata.scratch.mit.edu (scratch cloud server URL) is pointing to. There is still DNS but no ping. source  Make a new topic for cloud data problems.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>✉️ Website Bugs:</strong>
<br>
Sometimes the 1st comment on your profile is older then the account. source
Sometimes signatures go too high and show the purple background. source
<br>

Sign in and join scratch hover background doesn't fit the navbar on 2.0 pages.
<br>
Scratch is indexing projects slowly.  source
When ST merges a topic, it says the wrong OP. source
<br>
<br>
Sometimes project thumbnails break. source
<br>

Next function does not work on https://scratch.mit.edu/accounts/login/ when you log in with a next function (e.g. ?next=/mystuff/) it does not work.
When making a comment with an unsupported emoji, the error is broken. source
<br>

When deleting a studio, the alert is empty.
<br>
Sort by studio's Hosted by Me is forever stuck at empty.
<br>
Debug button in editor's hover background color width is too small.
<br>
Bad margin here.
<br>
“”report“ button” should be capitalized, I mean your directly stating the name of the button which is “Report” not “report”, if it was just “report” not in quotes, sure it would work fine.
<br>
New topic tool-tip should be updated to reflect the new forums.
<br>
On the BBCode toolbar, the icons with drop-downs are bigger than the arrows, also the scratchblocks icon in the BBCode bar is the 2.0 stack block.
<br>
When hovering over messages on 3.0 pages the unread messages counter doesn't expand with the icon.
<br>
Search bar on 2.0 pages has a little inlet div. Also highlight is blue, but that's for Color Consistiencies in Accessibility Update List
<br>
Studios the Project is in counter in my stuff always shows 0.
<br>
On 3.0 pages scratch wiki would link to scratch-wiki.info, but on 2.0 pages it links to wiki.scratch.mit.edu.
<br>
<br>
Explore page doesn't locale to your language.
<br>
Sometimes when posting a new post to a topic (e.g. bumping) it will not go to page 1, so you would have to bump twice or add on to things.
You can go to any site in the post preview (the  button), this is because it is an Iframe (embed), which should be fixed.
Last post will say the wrong last post. (take for example right now:
<br>
the last post was not in 2021)
On 2.0 pages, when scratch is loading the page, at the bottom you still see “Adobe Flash Player is not supported”.
Sometimes when you comment, you comment twice, this may be due to the messages not loading bug or internet issues.
<br>
Some categories on the homepage do not show, scratch is also temporarily disabling FPC (Front Page Curator) due to homepage issues. 
<br>
Firefox has worse performance when running scratch projects, however, you can always try fixing NextDNS. source 
On 2.0 pages, you can hover over the logo from 2 pixels down, this is due to there being an <a> tag being that size. (80 x 48)
<br>
On 2.0 pages, there is no <hr> tag on account drop-down.
<br>
Some users made topics/posts but the counter says 0. source
<br>
Sort by remixes doesn't show all projects and is in the wrong order. source
<br>

<strong>❓ QNA:</strong>
<br>
❓ Q: Why doesn't my backpack load when I put stuff inside of it?
  <br>
❗️ A: The backpack has a file limit, try deleting things.
<br>
❓Q: Why doesn't my thing save in the editor?
  <br>
❗️ A: The project.json file cannot exceed 5 MB, this means the code, info about sprites and assets, and any list values, no asset (sound, costumes) cannot exceed 10 MB.
<br>
❓ Q: How do I report bugs?
  <br>
❗️ A: A bug description, when it started, where it is, a link (if it's in a specific project, please link to it), reproduction steps, expected result, actual result, operating system, browser and Flash version (should be already there. if not, click the globe icon in the tools bar above the topic itself), screenshot.
